// Every thing in java is pass by reference


// Variable are like container that hold some data

    // Type of variable
        // local variable -> declared in a method and has scope in that method
        // Instance variable -> declared in a class without static keyword that is accessible by instance and different value for different instance of that class if it is not private
        // static variable -> declared in a class it can be accessible to all the and same for each variable, but it should call using with class name Ex = ClassName.variableName is must be static


    // All below variable are instance variable
    // All below are primitive data type

    }

    // Some literals and rules

    // for int
    int octal = 0234; // if value of int variable start with 0 without x and b then it is consider as octal number
    int hex = 0x4334; // if value of int variable start with 0 followed by x then it is consider as hexa-decimal number;
    int binary = 0b101010; //  if value of in variable start 0 followed by b and other digit are 0 or 1 are consider as binary number


// Type conversion
    // Automatic Type Conversion Ex = byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double
    // explicit Type Conversion Ex =  byte <- short <- int <- long <- float <- double
    int a = (int)'a';
    int b = (int)4.3f;
// Type Promotion in Expressions
    double result = (f * b) + (age / ages) - (d * ch); // here all type is promoted to double





    // Non-primitive data type
        // String
        // Array
        // Class/Object/Interface etc is used to make own user defined data type

// JVM / JDK / JRE / JIT

// JDK = Java Development Kit is a software development environment consist tool and libraries and JRE
// JRE = Java Runtime Environment provide requirement for execution of code and it consist JVM and core classes and supporting files
// JVM = Java Virtual Machine is responsible of executing the java program


// compilation process
    // .java file compile and converted into .class(byteCode) file that execute on any platform using JVM



// Operators are same as c++ so all operator i know
