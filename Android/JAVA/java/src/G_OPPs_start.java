//Class = blueprint, prototype, logical entity, group of object which have same properties
//Object = instance of class, real world entity , logical or physical entity , it has some state, behavior, identity
// 4 Piller of Opps
//        Abstraction = It is property by virtue of which only essential details are displayed to user
//        Encapsulation = Wrapping up of data under a single unit  protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield, data-hiding interchangeably used at encapsulation
//        Inheritance = It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features of another class. It provides reusability and follows DRY principle
                // Single Inheritance
                // Multilevel Inheritance
                // Hierarchical Inheritance
            //note ** Multiple Inheritance not allowed in java because of the of change of ambiguity due to two member in different class has same name
                    // because of the  Multiple Inheritance not allowed hybrid inheritance is also not possible
//        Polymorphism = Ability to differentiate between entities of same name with help of signature and declaration of these entities
                //Method overloading = when a method is inherited from another class is change and change is body, it decided at run-time
                //Method overriding = method with same name but different signature , at compile-time
// Some important topic
    // Coupling = Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class, classes are aware of each other
            // Tight Coupling = Tight coupling means the two classes often change together, More interdependency between class, More coordination , More information flow
            // Loose Coupling = loose coupling means they are mostly independent. If the only knowledge that class A has about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, Less interdependency between class, Less coordination , Less information flow
    // Cohesion = Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.
    // Association = Association is a relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.
            // Aggregation = one-way relationship  For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature,  both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.
            // Composition = It represents part-of relationship , In composition, both entities are dependent on each other, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity
