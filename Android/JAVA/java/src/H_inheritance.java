//  Note: In Java, constructor of the base class with no argument gets automatically called in the derived class constructor. in top-up manner from base class to derived class
// whenever inherit a class then base has a construct that called using super() or  a default construct should provided which automaticaly calls


// Super keyword = The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects
    // Used to access parents_class variable,methods,call super constructor



// Packages
    // Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces
    // Used for preventing naming conflicts
    // Providing controlled access
    // import package.name.*;
    // package creation  =  javac Welcome.java && javac -d . Welcome.java && java FirstPackage.Welcome
    // there is many in-build packages such as java.lang or java.utils or java.io or java.awt etc
