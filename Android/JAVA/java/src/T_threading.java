//When multiple threads are working on the same data, and the value of our data is changing, that scenario is not thread-safe and we will get inconsistent results
// Thread safety is done using keyword or modifiers like
// Synchronization = it only one thread at a time to complete the particular task. It means when multiple threads executing simultaneously, and want to access the same resource at the same time, then the problem of inconsistency will occur. so synchronization is used to resolve inconsistency problem by allowing only one thread at a time.
// Volatile = t ensures that the object can be used by multiple threads at the same time without having any problem.
// Atomic Variable = atomic variable ensures that threads don’t crash into each other.

// Some basic differences of using Thread class and runnable class

//        If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
//        We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
//        Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.



//        Daemon thread in Java is a low-priority thread that runs in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection
//        A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing
